# twitter_snippet_maker

So I ran into this problem. Whenever I want to capture a snippet of my screen and post it on Twitter it always gets misplaced because it's too small or out of ratio. That's when this script comes in. It'll take your snippet and superimpose it on a grayish background that is the recommended size by Twitter and put it in the center of that background.
